issue on the Quotex platform.

Rayaz initiated a withdrawal request on September 11, 2024, but 49 days
have passed without the funds being credited to his account.

## Complaint Details

### Unreturned Funds

-   Rayaz\'s funds have not been credited to his bank account or
    returned to his Quotex wallet.
-   He has provided Quotex with all necessary documentation, including a
    bank statement and an official bank letter confirming that no such
    transaction has been received.

### Lack of Transparency and Support

-   The Quotex support team has not provided critical information like
    the SWIFT code, which is required by Rayaz\'s bank to trace the
    transaction.
-   Each response attributes the delay to their "financial
    operator" without any specifics, which has added to Rayaz\'s
    frustration.

### Financial and Personal Impact

-   The prolonged delay has placed a strain on Rayaz\'s family\'s
    finances, and these funds are urgently needed.
-   This experience has been extremely disappointing and stressful.

## Request for Brokersview\'s Assistance

Rayaz has requested BrokersView\'s assistance in urging Quotex to
expedite the process and credit his funds back to his bank account or
Quotex wallet.

He trusts that BrokersView can assist in resolving this matter promptly,
as this delay has been far longer than reasonable.
